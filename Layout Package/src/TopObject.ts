//===================================================================
// Class for the object that serves as the root/top of a drawing object tree.
// This object is associated with a particular canvas and sets things
// up so drawing occurs here.  This object also takes care of the various aspects of
// the damage management, layout, and redraw processes that need to happen from the 
// top of the tree.
//
// Note: We are not processing input using a normal input/damage/redraw cycle in this
// project.  Therefore, this class provides some extra methods to deal with that.
// Specifically, to cause layout and drawing after a change, the method 
// layoutAndDrawAll() should be called explicitly after a batch of damage has occured.
// There are also special methods in this class to respond when asynchronous image
// loading completes -- these cause a call to layoutAndDamage() in order to make 
// those images appear correctly.
