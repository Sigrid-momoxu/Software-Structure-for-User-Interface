// Base class for objects for hierarchically drawn objects v1.0a 9/23
// 
// This class is the central base class for SSUI project #2.  It provides  the basic 
// operations for a hieractical collection of objects which can draw output in an HTML
// canvas (i.e., simple output-only interactors).  Useful objects of this sort
// will all be subclasses of this base class.  
//
// For this project you are being ask to provide some of the implementation of this
// class along with a number of subclasses.
//
// This class provides implementtion or partial implementation in six categories:
//   * Constructor, properties, and property accessors.  
//   * A child list and parent "back pointer" to implement the tree establishing 
//     drawing hierarchy; along with methods for adding and removing children.
//   * Methods for hierachical drawing.
//   * Methods implementing layout (size and positioning) for objects.
//   * Methods for tracking damage (areas which need to be redrawn)
//   * Some debugging aids which e.g., provide human-readable strings useful for
//     displaying objects in textual debugging output.
// 
// PROPERTIES
// Key properties include those that determine the current size and position of the 
// object (x,y, w,h); size configuration information that determine the sizing 
// capabilities of this object (minimum, natural, and maximum width and hieght: 
// wConfig, hConfig); and whether the object is currently visible (visible).  All 
// properties use protected storage (declared in "_name" form), along with get and/or
// set accessors (declared with a "plain" name), and in some cases additional accessors
// which break out parts of a value or set related values together.
//
// DRAWING
// Objects are drawn using a hierarchical coordinate system.  Each object is placed
// at some x,y position within it's parent's coordinate system, then esstablishes it's
// own local coordinate system with it's top-left forming the origin (with the y-axis
// pointing down on the screen).  Each object also maintains a width and height, which 
// along with its position establishes a bounding box of the object.  All drawing output
// for the object and all of its children are clipped to that bounding box.  
//
// LAYOUT
// Layout is done in a two-pass fashion -- first bottom up to determine available size
// ranges, then a top down pass establishing final size and position of each objects.
// Objects use width and hieght configuration objects (wConfig, hConfig) to express the
// set of sizes they are capable of taking on.  Each of the configurations expresses a 
// minimum, natural, or desired, and maximum size for the object.  For simple objects,
// these values are typically determined by the contents of the object.  For example,
// a TextObject has a fixed size (min=natural=max) which is determined by the text it 
// draws (along with its font, etc.). Layout containers will use the size configuration 
// information of their children to determine their own size configuration, and will in 
// the second pass of the layout implementation estabish the actual size and position 
// of each of their children.  
//
// DAMAGE MANAGEMENT
// Each time something about an object changes in a way that should be reflected by a 
// visual image for the object, it must declare "damage" indicating what part of its 
// display may need to be udpated (by calling damageArea()) or that it's full display 
// might need to be updated (by calling damageAll()).  Note that it is safe to 
// declare more damaged area that could actually change, so it is allways safe to
// call damageAll() (and most code defaults to doing that rather than working out 
// the exact area of damage).
